# Paket.Unity3D

An extension for the [Paket][11] dependency manager that enables the integration of NuGet dependencies into [Unity3D][12] projects.

## Why Paket.Unity3D?

While dependency managers like [NuGet][13] & [Paket][11] exist for .NET/Mono projects there is no easy way to manage dependencies for [Unity3D][12] projects.

Paket.Unity3D tries to solve this by adding NuGet libraries as Assets of a [Unity3D][12] project in a designated `Paket.Unity3D` directory.

Furthermore Paket.Unity3D works on the command-line and can be integrate into the build process.
